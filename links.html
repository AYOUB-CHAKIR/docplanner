    <p> She closed her eyes and then opened them again.<br/>What she was seeing just didn't make sense.<br/>She shook her head seeing if that would help.<br/>It didn't.<br/>Although it seemed beyond reality, there was no denying she was witnessing a large formation of alien spaceships filling the sky.
        The computer wouldn't start.<br/>She banged on the side and tried again.<br/>Nothing.<br/>She lifted it up and dropped it to the table.<br/>Still nothing.<br/>She banged her closed fist against the top.<br/>It was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence.
        There were a variety of ways to win the game.<br/>James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what his opponent was trying to do.<br/>There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his.<br/>He began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past.<br/>So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat him in the game.
        The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on.<br/></p>

    <p>
        The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone.<br/>The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away.<br/>The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it.<br/>When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
        Stranded.<br/>Yes, she was now the first person ever to land on Venus, but that was of little consequence.<br/>Her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here, but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her.<br/>She looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order.<br/>She was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last.
        There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread.<br/>The old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around, and while he was gone the old woman, his wife, did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land.
        Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette.<br/>The morning dew had made her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air.<br/>There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the morning.
        It really doesn't matter what she thinks as it isn't her problem to solve.<br/>That's what he kept trying to convince himself.<br/>She was trying to insert her opinion where it wasn't wanted or welcome.<br/>He already had a plan and even though that plan didn't correspond with what she wanted him to do or what should be done, it wasn't her decision to make.<br/>The question now became whether he would stick to his convictions and go through with his plan knowing she wouldn't approve.
        She put the pen to paper but she couldn't bring herself to actually write anything.<br/>She just stared at the blank card and wondered what words she could write that would help in even a small way.<br/>She thought of a dozen ways to begin but none seemed to do justice to the situation.<br/>There were no words that could help and she knew it.
        Stormi is a dog.<br/>She is dark grey and has long legs.<br/>Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know what she is thinking.<br/>Her tongue is long, pink, and wet.<br/>Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        She can be a good dog, but also very bad.<br/>Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad.<br/>Stormi is a dog I love.
        The box sat on the desk next to the computer.<br/>It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier.<br/>She didn't who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been.<br/>As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life.
        It was a weird concept.<br/>Why would I really need to generate a random paragraph? Could I actually learn something from doing so? All these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button.<br/>To her surprise, she found what she least expected to see.
        He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence.<br/>There was no doubt that he was smart.<br/>The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
        The light was out on the front porch of the house.<br/>This was strange.<br/>Judy couldn't remember a time when she had ever seen it out.<br/>She hopped out of her car and walked to the door.<br/>It was slightly ajar and she knew this meant something terrible.<br/>She gently pushed the door open and hall her fears were realized.<br/>"Surprise! Happy Birthday!" everyone shouted.
        It was just a burger.<br/>Why couldn't she understand that? She knew he'd completely changed his life around her eating habits, so why couldn't she give him a break this one time? She wasn't even supposed to have found out.<br/>Yes, he had promised her and yes, he had broken that promise, but still in his mind, all it had been was just a burger.
        This is important to remember.<br/>Love isn't like pie.<br/>You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones.<br/>No matter how much love you give, you can always give more.<br/>It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out.<br/>Give it freely and as much as you want.
        They argue.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's always the same.<br/>Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing.<br/>They both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue.<br/>So they continue to argue.
        No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened.<br/>It didn't even really make sense to him.<br/>All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in his body allowed him to move.<br/>It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn't move to intervene.<br/>He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth.
        Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish.<br/>It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul's summer day.<br/>It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood.<br/>She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken.<br/>She was just having a good cry all to herself.<br/>The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps.
        He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate.<br/>He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time.<br/>It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it.<br/>Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.
        The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox.<br/>It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well.<br/>The other toys grumbled beneath.<br/>At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.
        She was infatuated with color.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        She didn't have a favorite color per se, but she did have a fondness for teals and sea greens.<br/>You could see it in the clothes she wore that color was an important part of her overall style.<br/>She took great pride that color flowed from her and that color was always all around her.<br/>That is why, she explained to her date sitting across the table, that she could never have a serious relationship with him due to the fact that he was colorblind.
        She glanced up into the sky to watch the clouds taking shape.<br/>First, she saw a dog.<br/>Next, it was an elephant.<br/>Finally, she saw a giant umbrella and at that moment the rain began to pour.
        He knew what he was supposed to do.<br/>That had been apparent from the beginning.<br/>That was what made the choice so difficult.<br/>What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same.<br/>This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
        It had become a far too common an event in her life.<br/>She has specifically placed the key to the box in a special place so that she wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed.<br/>Now that she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.
        He had done everything right.<br/>There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process.<br/>It had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost.
        The alarm went off at exactly 6:00 AM as it had every morning for the past five years.<br/>Barbara began her morning and was ready to eat breakfast by 7:00 AM.<br/>The day appeared to be as normal as any other, but that was about to change.<br/>In fact, it was going to change at exactly 7:23 AM.
        The rain and wind abruptly stopped, but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance.<br/>Dave knew this feeling all too well.<br/>The calm before the storm.<br/>He only had a limited amount of time before all Hell broke loose, but he stopped to admire the calmness.<br/>Maybe it would be different this time, he thought, with the knowledge deep within that it wouldn't.
        They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy.<br/>They had planned the trip for more than a year and both were so excited they could barely control themselves.<br/>They still hadn't realized that Las Vegas promised a place where dreams come true, it was actually the place where dreams came to die.
        Time is all relative based on age and experience.<br/>When you are a child an hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that’s all the time you are allowed on your iPad.<br/>As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the more you procrastinate.<br/>As a young adult, you think you have forever to live and don’t appreciate the time you spend with others.<br/>As a middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up.<br/>And finally, as you get old and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer demands on you, time slows.<br/>You appreciate each day and are thankful you are alive.<br/>An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can feel so different in how it goes by.
        I'm going to hire professional help tomorrow.<br/>I can't handle this anymore.<br/>She fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter.<br/>This is much more than I ever signed up to do.
        "What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked.<br/>He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn't like his answer.<br/>He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt.<br/>How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?
        Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera.<br/>

        She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled through thousands of images on your computer.<br/>She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken.<br/>She could remember where she had been, what she was thinking as she tried to get the shot, the smells of the surrounding area, and even the emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering what she had for breakfast.
The towels had been hanging from the rod for years.<br/>They were stained and worn, and quite frankly, just plain ugly.<br/>Debra didn't want to touch them but she really didn't have a choice.<br/>It was important for her to see what was living within them.
The paper was blank.<br/>It shouldn't have been.<br/>There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more.<br/>The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating.<br/>Actually, it was even more than frustrating.<br/>It was downright distressing.
I'm so confused by your ridiculous meltdown that I must insist on some sort of explanation for your behavior towards me.<br/>It just doesn't make any sense.<br/>There's no way that I deserved the treatment you gave me without an explanation or an apology for how out of line you have been.
He stepped away from the mic.<br/>This was the best take he had done so far, but something seemed missing.<br/>Then it struck him all at once.<br/>Visuals ran in front of his eyes and music rang in his ears.<br/>His eager fingers went to work in an attempt to capture his thoughts hoping the results would produce something that was at least half their glory.
The kids were loud.<br/>They were way too loud for Jerry, especially since this was a four-hour flight.<br/>The parents didn't seem to be able, or simply didn't want, to control them.<br/>They were yelling and fighting among themselves and it was impossible for any of the passengers to concentrate or rest.<br/>He thought about politely tapping on the parents' shoulders and asking them to try and get their kids under a bit more control, but before he did he came up with a better idea.<br/>Sure, it was a bit sinister, and he'd probably end p in a lot of trouble, but he really didn't care at that point.
Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now.<br/>He wasn't sure what exactly had made him choose this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time.<br/>He looked straight into her eyes and just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.
Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper.<br/>There was room for five more stars but they would be difficult ones to earn.<br/>It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were considered the "easy" ones.
The day had begun on a bright note.<br/>The sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week, and the birds were singing in its warmth.<br/>There was no way to anticipate what was about to happen.<br/>It was a worst-case scenario and there was no way out of it.
She counted.<br/>One.<br/>She could hear the steps coming closer.<br/>Two.<br/>Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth.<br/>Three.<br/>He stopped beside her.<br/>Four.<br/>She pulled the trigger of the gun.
The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination.<br/>While people may have called it a "bridge", the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes.<br/>It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man.<br/>The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it.
There was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe.<br/>

 All one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty.<br/>Yet Bob didn't see another option.<br/>He may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through, but time was something he didn't have.<br/>A choice needed to be made, and it needed to be made quickly.
Mary had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, it would upset someone.<br/>It seemed like such a silly reason for people to get upset but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there was no way everyone in her life would be pleased with what she ultimately decided to do.<br/>It was simply a question of who she would rather displease most.<br/>While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was herself.
The picket fence had stood for years without any issue.<br/>That's all it was.<br/>A simple, white, picket fence.<br/>Why it had all of a sudden become a lightning rod within the community was still unbelievable to most.<br/>Yet a community that had once lived in harmony was now divided in bitter hatred and it had everything to do with the white picket fence.
He looked at the sand.<br/>Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand.<br/>Hundreds of thousands? "Not enough," the said under his breath.<br/>I need more.
There was a leak in the boat.<br/>Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would for the next couple of hours.<br/>This was a problem since the boat was heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered.<br/>John had planned it exactly this way.
It was a rat's nest.<br/>Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up.<br/>It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it.<br/>She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it.<br/>It wasn't.<br/>She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers.
